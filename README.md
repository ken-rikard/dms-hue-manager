**Note:** A Hue Bridge is required for [OpenHue](https://www.openhue.io/) to
manage your devices.

## Features

- **Supports both lights and rooms**: Control an entire room or individual
  lights
- **Guided setup**: Prompts for OpenHue bridge pairing if not already configured
- **Real-time updates**: Listens to your Hue Bridge's event stream for real-time
  updates, instantly reflecting any changes made via the app or automations
- **Brightness and temperature control**: Manually control a devices's
  brightness level and temperature value
- **Color control**: Leverages the builtin DMS color picker to set a devices's
  color directly
- **Scenes**: Easily switch between your predefined scenes for each room
- **Device icons**: Maps your Philips Hue icons to the closest equivalent from
  Material Symbols
- **Theme accent sync**: Automatically syncs your lights to the current DMS
  accent colour whenever the theme changes, light/dark mode toggles, or
  Matugen generates new colours from your wallpaper. You can select which
  rooms to sync, or leave it empty to sync all rooms.
